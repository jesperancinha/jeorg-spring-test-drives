<i>See [Hints&Tricks](https://github.com/jesperancinha/project-signer/blob/master/project-signer-templates/Hints%26Tricks.md)
document for more details</i>
```bash
mvn clean install -Dconsolerizer.show=false
```

## Install JDK using [SDK-MAN](https://sdkman.io/)

```bash
. ./sdk19.sh
```

## Detect Non-Running Tests

```bash
mvn clean install | egrep "Tests run|----"
```
## Sequence Diagram

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant USER
    participant SPRING
    participant Spring Professional
    
    rect rgb(1,130,25)
    
    USER->>SPRING: User studies spring
    
    SPRING->>Spring Professional: User becomes
 
    loop Keep updated
         Spring Professional->>SPRING: User studies again
    end
    end
```

<i>Note: You need a Mermaid plugin extension</i>

## Running unit and integration tests

The examples presented in this repo need to use a docker-engine/docker-machine in order to run.

This is because they make use of the [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) project.

I tested this using Docker Desktop for mac and on an ubuntu-unity machine. As long as the docker-machine/docker-engine is running, the maven build shoud also work.

Using embedded alternatives revealed to be quite cumbersome, inefficient and slow.

For more info on docker desktop please check their [website](https://www.docker.com/).

For learning how to install docker in ubuntu please check their [website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

When this is ready, just run:

```shell
make build
```

or

```shell
mvn clean install
```
