## Build

Note that if you want to build this project from the root, you need to use one of the JDK 11 or upper versions.

<i>See [Hints&Tricks](https://github.com/jesperancinha/project-signer/blob/master/project-signer-templates/Hints%26Tricks.md)
document for more details</i>
```bash
mvn clean install -Dconsolerizer.show=false
```

## Install JDK using [SDK-MAN](https://sdkman.io/)

1.  List all Java versions and select the appropriate on currently used in the project. Check the [pom.xml](pom.xml) file for details.
```shell
sdk list java
```

2.  Install the java version

```shell
sdk install java <JDK_VERSION>
```

3.  Use the JDK version

```shell
sdk use java <JDK_VERSION>
```

## Detect Non-Running Tests

```
## Sequence Diagram

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant USER
    participant SPRING
    participant Spring Professional
    
    rect rgb(1,130,25)
    
    USER->>SPRING: User studies spring
    
    SPRING->>Spring Professional: User becomes
 
    loop Keep updated
         Spring Professional->>SPRING: User studies again
    end
    end
```

<i>Note: You need a Mermaid plugin extension</i>

## Tech-stack Cloud

`@Transational timeout`, `TestRestTemplate`, `HealthIndicator`, `actuator`, `Embedded`, `JPA`, `Big Data`

## Running unit and integration tests

The examples presented in this repo need to use a docker-engine/docker-machine in order to run.

This is because they make use of the [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) project.

I tested this using Docker Desktop for mac and on an ubuntu-unity machine. As long as the docker-machine/docker-engine is running, the maven build shoud also work.

Using embedded alternatives revealed to be quite cumbersome, inefficient and slow.

For more info on docker desktop please check their [website](https://www.docker.com/).

For learning how to install docker in ubuntu please check their [website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

When this is ready, just run:

```shell
make build
```

or

```shell
mvn clean install
```
